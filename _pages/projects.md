Project 6: Analytics AI|
Banged my head against distributed systems |
It required to unlearn and relearn many of the known stuffs against distributed systems starting from multiple code repos, CI/CD, logging, monitoring, security to deploying into docker-kubernetes world|
Project 5: DevOps team|
Migrated 12 years old platform into a new DevOps CI based platform that needs painstaking technical skills from dockerizing, shell commands, python, groovy, robot scripts and especially that involved merging multiple GIT repo into one, groovy script adaptation|
Project 4 - Product:	[Network Analyzer – Copper & Fiber](https://www.nokia.com/networks/solutions/home-and-access-analytics/)|
Designing features on top of micro services platforms gave me an opportunity to write software modules with high performance in large scales with auto scaling|
Apart from designing, end-end feature development, fixing the scalability issues & performance tuning were the other fun things I did|

[Dhyan Networks](https://www.dhyan.com/), Chennai, India, 2011-2014|

Project 3 - Product: Verizon Management Systems (VMS)|
Developing features like LDAP, IWA, Cluster (Master Slave, Load balancer), and GR Cluster were the best of them|
Project 2 - Product: [Element Manager](https://www.dhyan.com/technology/#1585825471317-07c2a561-488b)|
Features like Performance monitoring; Discovery, Accounting, managing SOAP based web services etc were so challenging one which gave me the most valuable learning curve in my career|
Project 1 - Product: [NetMan – DNMS](https://www.dhyan.com/solutions/element-network-management-system/develop-a-new-ems/#netman-product-tour) |
